//The  basic  bet  made  by  the  “shooter” in this game is the pass-line bet. 
// To start a pass-line round, the shooter makes a “come-out”  roll.  
//A  come-out  roll  of  2,  3,  or  12  is  called  “craps”  or  “crapping  out,”  and  the  shooter  loses.  
//A  come-out  roll  of  7  or  11  is  a  “natural,”  and  the  shooter  wins.  
//The  other possible numbers are the point numbers: 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10. 
//If the shooter rolls one of  these  numbers  on  the  come-out  roll,  this  establishes  the  “point”—to  win,  
//the  point  number must be rolled again before a seven. 
//So in the case where a “point” is established 
//the shooter rolls over and over until either the point is rolled (a win) or a seven is rolled (a loss). 
//Using your week1.Groupn_Ex2 class for a pair of dice, simulate 100,000 pass-line bets and output how many result in a win, 
//and how many result in a loss. 
//In a readme file included in your project, write about the result you observe. (6/14) [25 points]
