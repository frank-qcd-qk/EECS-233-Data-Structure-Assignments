# Problem 1 Writeup:

In this file we have conducted a multirun test. We observed that for 100,000 runs, the result are follows:

- win: 49390
- lose: 50610

In addition to this run, we made another several 100k runs, result are follows:

|      |     |     | wins  | loses |
| :--: | :-: | :-: | ----- | ----- |
| run1 |     |     | 49248 | 50752 |
| run2 |     |     | 49042 | 50958 |
| run3 |     |     | 49401 | 50599 |

In summary it is clear that this game is not a 50% win-lose rate but rather more people loses than wins.
However, to be fair, this game with current setting is relatively fair compared to some of the casino game's 10% win rate.

In addition, our generation mode of he java random is considered to provide us a pretty generic distribution therefore the only variable will be caused by the game setting, hence which numbers are guaranteed win/lose.
